   Service worker

   Owns the toolbar badge — the extension's smallest surface, and the only part
   of the UI visible when the popup is closed. It has to obey the same design
   system as everything else, so the badge colour is derived from the live
   theme rather than hard-coded ad-hoc hexes.

   The colours below are the primary / onPrimary pair produced by
   M3EColor.scheme("#5B4CF5", { variant: "vibrant" }) for light and dark.
   They are inlined on purpose: an MV3 service worker that importScripts a
   sibling file fails the entire worker registration if that file is missing
   or fails to resolve at install time (NetworkError on WorkerGlobalScope).
   Keeping the worker self-contained means the badge still paints even when
   the shared colour engine is unavailable to this context.
